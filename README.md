Starbucks Stock Price Prediction Project
Overview
This project focuses on predicting the stock prices of Starbucks by harnessing a rich dataset encompassing the past decade, spanning from 2014 to the present. Leveraging machine learning techniques, particularly Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks—a type of recurrent neural network (RNN)—this endeavor seeks to forecast stock prices for the upcoming month, specifically targeting the period from December 11, 2023, to January 11, 2024.

Methodology
Data Analysis
The project commences with a thorough analysis of historical stock price data. This involves exploring trends, patterns, and relevant features within the dataset to inform the predictive modeling process.

LSTM Implementation
Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, known for their effectiveness in capturing temporal dependencies, have been employed to implement the predictive model. LSTM's ability to retain and learn from long-term patterns makes it particularly suitable for forecasting financial time series data.

Results
The project culminates in the generation of a graphical representation, showcasing the comparative analysis between real and predicted stock prices during the specified timeframe. This visual representation serves to provide insights into the model's performance and its ability to capture nuanced market dynamics.
